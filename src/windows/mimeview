# Pseudo entry used if the 'use desktop' preference is set in the GUI
# Could not get the cmd-based ones to work (tried quoting "start %u" too)
#application/x-all = c:/Windows/System32/cmd /c start %u
#application/x-all = cmd /c start %u
application/x-all = rclstartw %u

####### Special ones
# Open the parent epub document for epub parts instead of opening them as
# html documents. This is almost always what we want.
text/html|epub = rclstartw %F;ignoreipath=1
# Parent open for fs file.
application/x-fsdirectory|parentopen = rclstartw %f
inode/directory|parentopen = rclstartw %f

# Examples for PDF. These can be set from the GUI preferences "editor applications" section. Select
# application/pdf, check "exception to desktop preferences, and enter something similar to the below
# values. 
# Evince is the only application which lets you specify a search string on the command line. The
# exact command value will need some tweaking (user name and version number).
